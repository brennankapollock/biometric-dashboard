I had a medical ketamine treatment yesterday evening, so I wonder if my brain was more able to be open. The dancing ahead of time also helped to relieve excessive physical energy and tension, so my body did not have as much of a strong response of vigorous shaking like the other times. I still had the buzzing and blood flow issues, but much less shaking.  "
