Participant Consent + Liability Waiver 
Thank you for taking part in our study exploring how sound and breathwork may affect the body. This form explains your rights, responsibilities, and how we will use your information. Please read carefully and ask questions if anything is unclear.
1. Purpose of the Study 
This study uses wearable devices (Apple Watch, Oura Ring, WHOOP, etc.) to collect biometric data such as heart rate, heart rate variability, activity levels, and sleep patterns. The goal is to explore how practices like breathwork and sound affect well-being.
2. Voluntary Participation 
Your participation is completely voluntary.
You may stop at any time, for any reason.
If you withdraw, your data will be removed if you request it.
3. Risks + Responsibilities 
Breathwork and movement may sometimes feel strenuous, emotional, or uncomfortable.
You are responsible for practicing safely, listening to your body, and stopping if you feel unwell.
Please consult your physician before participating, especially if you have any medical conditions (e.g., heart conditions, asthma, high blood pressure, pregnancy, seizures, recent injuries).
This study does not replace medical care or treatment. Facilitators are not medical doctors.
4. Data Collection + Privacy 
Your device may record biometric data (heart rate, HRV, activity, sleep, oxygenation).
Your name and personal identifiers will never be attached to this data.
Reports or publications will use anonymous or aggregated results only (e.g., “average heart rate decreased after the session”).
Data will be stored securely and accessed only by authorized study members.
Your data will never be sold or shared outside this study.
5. Media (Optional) 
We may take photos, video, or audio during the study.
These may be used for educational or promotional purposes.
You may choose not to be photographed/filmed—just let us know in advance.
6. Acknowledgement of Risk + Release of Liability 
By participating, you acknowledge that:
There are risks inherent in physical and emotional practices.
You assume full responsibility for your participation.
You waive any claims against the facilitators, instructors, Horizon House LLC, or associated organizations for injuries or damages arising from participation.
